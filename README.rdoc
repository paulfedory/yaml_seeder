= YamlSeeder
Seeds your ActiveRecord models from Foxy Fixture-like YAML files

== YAML seed files
YamlSeeder works upon seed files which are very similar to fixtures - the foxy-fixtures introduced in Rails 2.0. For example, consider a Company model and an Employee model, where an employee belongs to a company:

=== companies.yml
dunder:
  name: Dunder Mifflin

=== employees.yml
michael:
  name: Michael Scott
  company: dunder

It's a good idea to put these seed files in their own directory, say "db/seeds".

== Usage

Use YamlSeeder to seed your Rails database. If you're using Rails 2.3.4 or later, add the following to your "db/seeds.rb" file:

Dir.glob(RAILS_ROOT + '/db/seeds/*.yml').each do |file|
  YamlSeeder.seed('db/seeds', File.basename(file, '.*'))
end

If you're using an earlier version of 

== Notes
*If ID's are not specified in the YAML seed files, then they will be assigned by the normal creation of saving an ActiveRecord (ie. the next ID available)
*Currently, YamlSeeder only supports belong-to associations
